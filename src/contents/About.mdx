## About Me

I'm a Software Engineer and MSCS student at Duke University, specializing in AI Application Development and Full-Stack Engineering. I bridge the gap between complex algorithms and user-friendly products.

My experience is rooted in building high-impact tools. At the California Department of Public Health and AnsibleHealth, I engineered automation systems and healthcare data solutions that significantly improved workflow efficiency and data accessibility.

Currently, I am focused on Generative AI and Large Language Models. My recent work includes fine-tuning Llama and Gemma models for disaster tweet classification and leveraging GPT-4 Vision for creative full-stack applications. Whether leading a team to win a hackathon or optimizing backend pipelines, I am driven by building technology that solves real-world problems.
