Hi, I'm Dongping! I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at Duke University, where I'm diving deeper into AI and software development. Before Duke, I completed my Bachelor's at California State University - East Bay, and I've been fortunate to work on projects that sit at the intersection of technology and real-world impact.

My experience spans healthcare data solutions, automation, and AI applications. I've worked with the California Department of Public Health building tools that help teams work more efficiently, and spent a summer at AnsibleHealth developing systems that improved patient data accessibility. Lately, I've been especially excited about working with large language models—from fine-tuning Llama and Gemma models for disaster tweet classification to building full-stack applications that leverage GPT-4 Vision for creative storytelling. I love the challenge of taking complex problems and building elegant, user-friendly solutions.

Whether it's leading a team to first place at a hackathon with an AI life simulator or automating tedious workflows to free up time for more meaningful work, I'm driven by building things that make a difference. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn, collaborate, and create technology that genuinely helps people.
